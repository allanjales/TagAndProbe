# Where download DATA files

In this code we use simplified data from the main code. You can find the data we used testing this code [in this link](https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/lqHEasYWJpOZsfq). It is important that if the dataset is not simplified, it should be runned as input in `simplify_data.cpp`. For detailed information, please visit CMS Open Data Guide.

Note: Not simplified datas can be extracted by the main tool in tag and probe section.
